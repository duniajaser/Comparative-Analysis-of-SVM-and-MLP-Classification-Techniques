# Comparative-Analysis-of-SVM-and-MLP-Classification-Techniques

This repository contains all relevant materials for the case study on comparing the effectiveness of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) in classifying banknotes based on currency, denomination, and orientation. This project is part of the ENCS5141â€”Intelligent Systems Laboratory course at Birzeit University.

## Project Overview

The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the performance of SVM and MLP algorithms on a multi-feature dataset derived from banknotes. The project includes data preprocessing, application of PCA for dimensionality reduction, and extensive hyperparameter tuning.
